- **Minor versions** (X.Y.0): New features, significant enhancements
- **Patch versions** (X.Y.Z): Bug fixes, minor improvements

### Planning Horizon

- **Current Version**: Actively being delivered
- **Next 2-3 Versions**: Clearly defined with specific deliverables
- **Future Versions**: High-level themes and strategic direction

### Status Indicators

- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Delivered and validated
- 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**: Active development underway
- 📋 **PLANNED**: Scheduled but not yet started
- ⏸️ **PAUSED**: Temporarily on hold
- ❌ **CANCELLED**: No longer pursuing
