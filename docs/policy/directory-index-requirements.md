# Directory Index Requirements Policy

## Purpose

This policy mandates the presence of an index.md file in every folder under
the docs/ and scripts/ directories to ensure consistent navigation,
discoverability, and documentation quality across the repository.

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- All folders (directories) under the `docs/` directory
- All folders (directories) under the `scripts/` directory
- All contributors who create new folders or modify existing folder structures
- Automated documentation tools and workflows

This policy does not apply to:

- Hidden directories (starting with `.`)
- Build artifact directories (e.g., `node_modules`, `vendor`, `dist`, `build`)
- Individual files (only directories require index.md)
- Root-level directories outside of `docs/` and `scripts/`

## Policy Statement

Every folder within the `docs/` and `scripts/` directories MUST contain an
`index.md` file that catalogs the contents of that folder. This ensures that
users can navigate the documentation and scripts hierarchically and understand
the purpose and contents of each directory.

## Index File Requirements

### Mandatory Contents

Each `index.md` file MUST contain:

1. **Title** - A descriptive title indicating the folder path
   (e.g., "Docs Index: /docs/policy/security")

2. **Purpose Section** - A brief description of the folder's purpose and what
   types of content it contains

3. **Subfolders Section** - If the folder contains subdirectories, list them
   with links to their respective `index.md` files:
   ```markdown
   ## Subfolders

   - [subfolder-name/](./subfolder-name/index.md)
   ```

4. **Documents/Files Section** - List all immediate child markdown files
   (for docs/) or script files (for scripts/) with links:
   ```markdown
   ## Documents

   - [document-name](./document-name.md)
   ```

   or for scripts:
   ```markdown
   ## Scripts

   - [script-name](./script-name.py) - Brief description
   ```

5. **Metadata Section** - Document metadata including:
   - Document Type: index
   - Auto-generated status (if applicable)

   ```markdown
   ## Metadata

   - **Document Type:** index
   - **Auto-generated:** This file is automatically generated by
     rebuild_indexes.py
   ```

### Optional Contents

Index files MAY include:

- Extended descriptions of folder contents
- Usage guidelines for scripts
- Grouping of related documents
- Cross-references to related documentation
- Revision history

### Structure Example

```markdown
# Docs Index: /docs/policy/security

## Purpose

This folder contains security policies, standards, and procedures that govern
security practices across the organization.

## Subfolders

- [scanning/](./scanning/index.md)
- [access-control/](./access-control/index.md)

## Documents

- [security-policy](./security-policy.md)
- [incident-response](./incident-response.md)
