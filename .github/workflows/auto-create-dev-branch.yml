            A new development branch has been automatically created following the merge of PR #${prNumber}.
            
            ### Details
            - **Branch**: \`${branchName}\`
            - **Version**: ${nextVersion}
            - **Merged PR**: #${prNumber} - ${prTitle}
            - **Created**: ${new Date().toISOString()}
            
            ### Next Steps
            1. Checkout the new branch: \`git fetch origin && git checkout ${branchName}\`
            2. Begin development for version ${nextVersion}
            3. Create PRs targeting this branch for feature development
            4. When ready, merge this branch to main for release
            
            ### Branch Strategy
            This branch follows the semantic versioning patch increment strategy. It represents the next patch release after the current version.
