## Overview

This document provides guidance for creating and maintaining implementation plans in the `docs/planning/` directory. It complements the root ROADMAP.md (version planning) with detailed execution guidance.

## Two-Tier Planning System

### Tier 1: Version Planning (ROADMAP.md)
- **What**: Versions, releases, features
- **When**: Timeline and milestones
- **Who**: Everyone (broad audience)
- **Update**: Per release

### Tier 2: Implementation Planning (docs/planning/)
- **How**: Tasks, workflows, examples
- **Who**: Team allocation and resources
- **Audience**: Implementation teams
- **Update**: Weekly/sprint cycles

## Content Guidelines

### Task Descriptions

**Good Examples**:
```markdown
- Update bulk_update_repos.py with enterprise audit logging (4 hours)
- Deploy Grafana dashboard for metrics collection (3 hours)
- Conduct training session on API client usage (2 hours)
```

**Poor Examples**:
```markdown
- Update scripts
- Set up monitoring
- Train team
```

### Resource Allocation

**Format**:
```markdown
### Week 1 Resources
- 2 Senior Developers × 20 hours = 40 hours
- 1 DevOps Engineer × 10 hours = 10 hours
- Total: 50 hours
```

### Success Metrics

**Format**:
```markdown
| Metric | Baseline | Target | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Scripts integrated | 0% | 50% | 📊 Tracking |
| API errors | 10/mo | 0 | 📊 Tracking |
| MTTR | Unknown | <15min | 📊 Tracking |
```

## Phase Documentation

### Location
`docs/planning/phases/phase-X-name.md`

### Structure

Each phase document should include:

1. **Status**: Complete/In Progress/Planned
2. **Delivered**: Date of completion
3. **Effort**: Actual vs estimated time
4. **Overview**: What the phase accomplished
5. **Objectives**: Clear goals
6. **Deliverables**: Specific outputs with details
7. **Success Metrics**: How success was measured
8. **Impact**: Before/after comparison
9. **Lessons Learned**: What worked, what didn't
10. **Next Phase**: Link to subsequent work

### Example

```markdown
# Phase 2: Enterprise Libraries - Complete

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Delivered**: 2026-02-11  
**Effort**: 1 session (originally estimated 4 weeks)

## Overview
Transform automation from functional to enterprise-grade...

## Deliverables
1. Enterprise Audit Library (470 lines)
   - Transaction tracking
   - Security event logging
   ...
```

## Milestone Tracking

### Location
`docs/planning/milestones/`

### Format

```markdown
## Q1 2026 Milestones

### Milestone 1: Enterprise Foundation ✅
- Target: 2026-02-11
- Status: Complete
- Deliverables: 8 libraries, 2 frameworks
- Impact: Foundation ready for adoption

### Milestone 2: Integration Phase 📋
- Target: 2026-03-31
- Status: Planned
- Deliverables: 15+ scripts integrated
- Dependencies: Training complete
```

## Sprint Planning (Optional)

For teams using Agile/Scrum:

### Location
`docs/planning/sprints/sprint-N.md`

### Structure

```markdown
# Sprint N - [Sprint Goal]

**Duration**: 2 weeks (YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD)  
**Team**: [Team members]  
**Goal**: [One sentence sprint goal]

## Sprint Backlog
- [ ] Task 1 (8 story points) - @developer1
- [ ] Task 2 (5 story points) - @developer2

## Definition of Done
- Code reviewed and merged
- Tests passing
- Documentation updated

## Sprint Review
[Completed after sprint ends]
```

## Update Frequency

### Weekly Updates
- Update task status
- Add newly identified work
- Adjust resource allocation
- Update blockers and risks

### Monthly Reviews
- Review success metrics
- Update milestone progress
- Adjust medium-term goals
- Archive completed sprints

### Quarterly Planning
- Review long-term vision
- Update Year 1 roadmap
- Adjust strategic priorities
- Update resource forecasts

## Integration with Root ROADMAP.md

### Linking Strategy

Root ROADMAP.md should link to planning details:

```markdown
### Version 03.03.00 (Planned) - Q1 2026

**Planning Documentation**:
- 📋 [Complete Implementation Roadmap](docs/planning/README.md#short-term-goals-month-1)
- 🎯 [Week 1 Actions](docs/planning/README.md#immediate-actions-week-1)
- 📊 [Success Metrics](docs/planning/README.md#success-metrics)
```

Planning docs should reference versions:

```markdown
## Short-term Goals (Month 1)

**Target Version**: 03.03.00  
**See**: [Root ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md#version-030300) for version details
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

- ✅ Break work into measurable tasks
- ✅ Estimate effort in hours
- ✅ Assign priorities and owners
- ✅ Update frequently (weekly minimum)
- ✅ Link between tiers (version ↔ implementation)
- ✅ Include integration examples
- ✅ Track metrics and KPIs
- ✅ Document lessons learned

### Don'ts

- ❌ Mix version planning with task details
- ❌ Let planning docs go stale
- ❌ Forget to update status indicators
- ❌ Skip resource allocation
- ❌ Ignore dependencies and blockers
- ❌ Make plans without success criteria
- ❌ Duplicate information between tiers

## Validation

Planning documentation quality checklist:

- [ ] All required sections present
- [ ] Tasks have effort estimates
- [ ] Resources allocated by phase
- [ ] Success metrics defined
- [ ] Links to root ROADMAP.md
- [ ] Phase docs exist for completed work
- [ ] Milestones tracked
- [ ] Update dates current (<1 month old)

## Examples

### Good Example: Specific and Actionable

```markdown
## Week 1: Immediate Actions (40 hours)

### Priority 1: Critical Script Updates (13 hours)

1. **bulk_update_repos.py** (4 hours) - @dev1
   - Add AuditLogger integration
   - Use APIClient with rate limiting
   - Add error recovery with checkpointing
   - Success: Script passes integration tests

2. **auto_create_org_projects.py** (3 hours) - @dev2
   - Add audit logging
   - Use APIClient for GitHub API
   - Add metrics tracking
   - Success: Zero API rate limit errors
```

### Poor Example: Vague and Unmeasurable

```markdown
## Month 1

- Update some scripts
- Deploy monitoring
- Train team
- Improve performance
```
