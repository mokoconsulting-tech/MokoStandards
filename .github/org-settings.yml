# BRIEF: GitHub organization-level settings configuration for branch protection
# NOTE: Applied at organization level to protect main branch across all repositories

# Organization-level branch protection rules
# These settings apply to all repositories in the mokoconsulting-tech organization
#
# To apply these settings:
# 1. Go to GitHub Organization Settings → Repository → Rules → Rulesets
# 2. Create a new ruleset with these configurations
# 3. Apply to "All repositories" or specific repository patterns
#
# Alternatively, use GitHub API or terraform to automate:
# https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/rules

# Instructions for applying organization-level settings
#
# Method 1: GitHub Web UI
# -----------------------
# 1. Navigate to: https://github.com/organizations/mokoconsulting-tech/settings/rules
# 2. Click "New ruleset" → "New branch ruleset"
#
# For main branch protection:
# 3a. Configure:
#    - Name: "Protect main branch across all repositories"
#    - Enforcement status: Active
#    - Target repositories: All repositories
#    - Target branches: Include "main" and "master"
# 4a. Add rules as specified above
# 5a. Click "Create" to apply
#
# For reserved branch prefix (mokostandards*):
# 3b. Configure:
#    - Name: "Reserve mokostandards branch prefix"
#    - Enforcement status: Active
#    - Target repositories: All repositories
#    - Target branches: Include "mokostandards*"
# 4b. Add rules:
#    - Block creations
#    - Block updates
#    - Block deletions
#    - Block force pushes
# 5b. Click "Create" to apply
#
# For branch naming convention:
# 3c. Configure:
#    - Name: "Enforce branch naming convention"
#    - Enforcement status: Active
#    - Target repositories: All repositories
#    - Target branches: Include "~ALL", Exclude "main", "master", "dev", "staging", "production"
# 4c. Add rules:
#    - Branch name pattern
#    - Pattern: ^(dev|rc|version|dependabot|copilot|patch)/[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(/.*)?$
#    - This enforces semantic versioning with approved prefixes
# 5c. Click "Create" to apply
#
# Method 2: GitHub CLI
# --------------------
# Use `gh api` to create rulesets programmatically
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/rules
#
# Method 3: Terraform
# -------------------
# Use github_repository_ruleset resource
# See: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/integrations/github/latest/docs/resources/repository_ruleset
#
# Method 4: GitHub API
# --------------------
# POST /orgs/{org}/rulesets
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/rules#create-an-organization-repository-ruleset

# Notes:
# ------
# - Organization rulesets apply to all repositories and override repository-level settings
# - Administrators can be exempted via bypass_actors if needed for emergencies
# - This ensures consistent protection across all org repositories
# - Individual repositories can have additional (stricter) rules via settings.yml
# - Reserved branch prefixes (e.g., mokostandards*) prevent users from creating branches
#   that could conflict with automated workflows or system operations
# - The mokostandards* prefix is reserved for MokoStandards automated processes only
# - Branch naming convention enforces semantic versioning with approved prefixes:
#   - dev/X.Y.Z - Development branches
#   - rc/X.Y.Z - Release candidate branches
#   - version/X.Y.Z - Version maintenance branches
#   - dependabot/X.Y.Z - Automated dependency update branches
#   - copilot/X.Y.Z - GitHub Copilot automated branches
#   - patch/X.Y.Z - Patch/hotfix branches
#   - Optional suffix after version: prefix/X.Y.Z/description
# - Protected branches (main, master, dev, staging, production) are exempt from naming rules
