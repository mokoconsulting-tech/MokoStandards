## Roadmap Overview

This roadmap provides a structured delivery plan for the documentation suite governed by MokoStandards. The objective is to deliver a minimum viable documentation baseline quickly, then incrementally mature the ecosystem to support engineering, operations, governance, and audit readiness.

The roadmap is grouped into phased workstreams. Within each phase, activities are categorized into high, medium, and low priority based on delivery risk, regulatory exposure, and operational dependency.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Core Governance

Objective: Establish a stable baseline of core documentation that can be referenced by contributors, stakeholders, and auditors.

### Phase 1 Deliverables

**Existing Core Documents to Validate and Finalize**

*

**High Priority New or Enhanced Documents**

*

### Phase 1 Outcomes

By the end of Phase 1, the organization has a coherent documentation spine that:

* Clarifies system intent, architecture, and data flows.
* Defines how changes are proposed, reviewed, and deployed.
* Provides a consistent contribution and onboarding experience.
* Establishes a baseline of risk, compliance, and governance expectations.

## Phase 2: Reliability, Risk, and Service Management

Objective: Extend the documentation suite to explicitly support reliability engineering, operational resilience, risk management, and vendor oversight.

### Phase 2 High Priority Deliverables

*

### Phase 2 Medium Priority Deliverables

*

### Phase 2 Outcomes

Upon completion of Phase 2, the documentation suite:

* Enables structured incident response with clear roles and escalation paths.
* Supports business continuity and disaster recovery planning in a repeatable way.
* Defines data handling practices aligned to classification tiers.
* Clarifies service expectations with formalized service level objectives and policies.
* Positions the organization for audit readiness with a curated set of supporting documents.
* Introduces vendor risk evaluation criteria to formalize third party reviews.

## Phase 3: Experience, Accessibility, and Business Operations

Objective: Mature the surrounding ecosystem so that documentation supports human experience, accessibility, and cross functional operations.

### Phase 3 Medium Priority Deliverables

*

### Phase 3 Low Priority Deliverables

*

### Phase 3 Outcomes

With Phase 3 complete, the documentation framework:

* Provides a clear view of end to end user journeys for key personas.
* Embeds accessibility expectations into design and delivery practices.
* Offers structured criteria for accepting features into production.
* Documents engineering norms and working agreements in a single reference.
* Clarifies decision paths, authorities, and escalation models.
* Provides lightweight operational playbooks for business functions and partner engagements.

## Delivery Cadence and Governance

### Cadence

* Roadmap review cadence: Quarterly review aligned with planning cycles.
* Backlog refinement: Monthly grooming of documentation backlog with engineering and operations stakeholders.
* Acceptance criteria: Each document is considered complete when it has a defined owner, conforms to MokoStandards, and passes peer review.

### Governance and Ownership

* The Documentation Office coordinates roadmap execution and prioritization.
* Each document has a named content owner and at least one reviewer.
* Changes to this roadmap are managed through the standard change management process and tracked in the revision history table below.

## Open Items and Future Considerations

The following items are intentionally deferred and should be revisited as the ecosystem evolves:

* Alignment of documentation taxonomy with external knowledge bases and public portals.
* Integration of documentation status with CI CD or project management tooling.
* Automation for stub generation, header enforcement, and index rebuilding using MokoStandards utilities.
* Expansion of the roadmap to include product specific playbooks and line of business documentation.
