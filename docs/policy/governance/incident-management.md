# Incident Management Policy

**Status**: DRAFT
**Priority**: CRITICAL (Tier 1)
**Owner**: TBD
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-07

## Purpose

This policy establishes a framework for managing incidents to minimize impact and restore normal operations quickly.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- All systems and services
- Security incidents and operational incidents
- All personnel and on-call teams
- Third-party service providers

## Policy Statements

### Incident Classification

**To be defined:**
- Severity levels (P0, P1, P2, P3, P4)
- Classification criteria
- Impact and urgency matrix
- Service level targets by severity

### Escalation Procedures

**To be defined:**
- Escalation paths by severity
- On-call rotation and contacts
- Escalation timelines
- Management notification requirements

### Response Timelines

**To be defined:**
- Initial response time by severity
- Resolution time targets
- Status update frequency
- Communication requirements

### Post-Incident Review

**To be defined:**
- PIR requirements by severity
- Review timeline
- Action item tracking
- Knowledge base updates

## Implementation Status

⚠️ **This is a stub document created as part of the enterprise readiness initiative.**

See [ENTERPRISE-READINESS.md](../../ENTERPRISE-READINESS.md) for the complete roadmap.

Note: There is existing incident-response policy for WAAS. This general policy should incorporate and expand on those procedures.

## Next Steps

1. Assign document owner
2. Define incident severity levels
3. Document escalation procedures
4. Create incident response runbooks
5. Establish on-call rotation
6. Implement incident tracking system
