# MokoStandards Roadmap

## Scope and Intent

This document defines the authoritative roadmap for the Moko Consulting documentation ecosystem beginning with version **05.00.00**. It establishes the sequencing, intent, and enterprise maturity expectations for all documentation artifacts governed by MokoStandards.

The roadmap is forward-looking by design. Completed work prior to version 05.00.00 is considered baseline and is intentionally excluded. This file tracks **current and future-state documentation only**.
